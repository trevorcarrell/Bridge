How do you expect people to get arround the Bay Area for this kind of price? That traffic is already horrible but this just adds insult to injury! We need to subsidize the cost of public transit now!",

To my surprise, there wasn't! in the heart of silicon valley? At this point, it should be expected to have public WiFi given how much so many people depend on it. The city officials should work to provide internet for all of Palo Alto!",
